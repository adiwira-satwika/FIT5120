                In the data, we found out that most people having majority of halogen lights which create use more than 80% of energy comparing to LED.
                Imagine a<b> 10Watt LED bulb will only cost $0.024 in 8 hours</b>, a <b>50watt halogen will cost $0.12 per 8hours. </b>
                It seems to be a small number but if you have multiple halogen and you turn on for longer hour or used them for year,
                estimate that is how much energy you have spent. LED is acting more environment friendly as well compare to halogen.
                LED produce less 80% of heat compare to halogen.
