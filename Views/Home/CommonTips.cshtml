                        Especially, some of the house owners have upstairs and downstairs air conditioner/heater highly drove the energy usage.
                        In this case, if you have
                        <b> two, turn on the only one </b>

                    <p>
                        Surprisingly, when we go through the data, we found out heating your home almost occupied half of the electric bills.
                        Most people left their air conditioner on even they left their house to keep their house nice and warm.
                        Although, it will be cold if you are coming home from outside or moving from downstairs to upstairs,
                        try to
                        <b>wear jacket before air conditioner or heater warm your house.</b>

                        As the diagram previously water heating is the second biggest energy that is used in the household.
                        For every 60 litre of water heating, comparing the most common system that used by household there is about 39% people who is using electric,
                        42% using gas, the rest are using solar and heat pump. Considering cost effective in long term,
                        people who are using electric heating and are considering switching to new system can change to gas heating.

                    <p>
                        From the sustainability Victoria, as
                        <b>per 60 litre of water heating electric </b>cost you
                        <b>$395-$555</b> while<b> gas heating</b> for same amount will be costing from <b>$160-$370</b>.
                        From this data, it is easy to understand that every month electric heating user are paying double price for the energy usage on water heating.

                        In the data, we found out that most people having majority of halogen lights which create use more than 80% of energy comparing to LED.
                        Imagine a<b> 10Watt LED bulb will only cost $0.024 in 8 hours</b>, a <b>50watt halogen will cost $0.12 per 8hours. </b>
                        It seems to be a small number but if you have multiple halogen and you turn on for longer hour or used them for year,
                        estimate that is how much energy you have spent. LED is acting more environment friendly as well compare to halogen.
                        LED produce less 80% of heat compare to halogen.

                        Even the most efficient washing machine will take about 56.8L to 113.6L of water.
                        The cost per kilolitre of water in average at Australia is about $3.

                        The average fridge cost per year is about $243. In our data, most people tend to set their fridge to coolest,
                        in this situation if you set your fridge to the right temperature, you can save 20% energy of the fridge and reduce 20% cost of fridge energy consumption,
