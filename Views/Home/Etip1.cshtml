            Especially, some of the house owners have upstairs and downstairs air conditioner/heater highly drove the energy usage.

            Surprisingly, when we go through the data, we found out heating your home almost occupied half of the electric bills.
            Most people left their air conditioner on even they left their house to keep their house nice and warm.
            Although, it will be cold if you are coming home from outside or moving from downstairs to upstairs,
            try to
            <b>wear jacket before air conditioner or heater warm your house.</b>
            This can help you save a lot of the electric usage.
